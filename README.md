# VR_2022_Template
This is a starter project for VR with Unity 2022.3. VR in Unity 2022 has some improvements,
as well as a few stumbling blocks.  It includes direct interaction, grab interactables, and teleport.

It was written in Unity 2022.3.26f1 LTS, and everything is in VRScene.

The Build Settings are set so that you can deploy to Quest 2 and 3 devices.
